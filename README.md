## Run a production Database in K8s
1. Spin up a new Linux VM/AWS EC2 machine
2. Install `minikube` & `kubectl`
3. Run `setup.sh`
4. Follow the video & apply the configurations. Or take the shortcut by running `run-mysql-cluster.sh`.
5. Play around! The `db-queries.sh` file has the read and write requests.
6. Optionally run `cleanup.sh` to get a clean slate
